1️⃣ First: What Structural Patterns Are Really About

Forget GoF definitions for a second.
Structural patterns are about controlling how objects are connected, not how they are created or behave over time.
They answer questions like:
Who holds a reference to whom?
Who talks directly, and who shouldn’t?
How do I reshape existing objects without changing them?
They are about object wiring.

2️⃣ The Core Problem Structural Patterns Solve
Start with this very common situation

You already have:
working classes
stable logic
tested behavior

But now:
the shape of the system is wrong

Examples:
API mismatch
Too many dependencies
Ugly call chains
Exposed internals
Tight coupling

🔔 Intuition trigger
“The problem is not what the code does — it’s how it’s connected.”
