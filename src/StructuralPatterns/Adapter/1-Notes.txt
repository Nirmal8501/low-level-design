The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that
allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work
together.

PS:
Imagine you are working on an e-commerce application that needs to send email
notifications to customers. Currently, you are using your own in-house
EmailNotificationService, but now you want to integrate a popular third-party email
service like SendGrid. However, the interface for your in-house system and the SendGrid
service are incompatible.

Let's see how the Adapter Pattern can solve this problem.


Because when calling from main or any client, u shouldn'u try to tweak the params there as then the clientt knows,
also the new Grid class has no reason to change because of the emailService, hence Adapter pattern is usefyl.

Adapter:
does not change what happens
changes how objects connect

It reshapes the dependency graph.


9️⃣ When You SHOULD Think “Adapter”

Think Adapter when:

✅ You have an interface mismatch
✅ You integrate third-party / legacy code
✅ You don’t own the dependency
✅ You want zero client changes
✅ You need to translate data formats

Typical triggers:

“It almost matches”
“Just need a small conversion”
“Can’t touch that code”

🔟 When You Should NOT Use Adapter

❌ To add business logic
❌ To fix bad domain design
❌ To hide complexity (use Facade)
❌ To extend behavior (use Decorator)
❌ When you control both sides
