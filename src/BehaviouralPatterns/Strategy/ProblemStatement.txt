Motivation:

Let's consider a simple payment system where users can pay using different
methods like credit cards or PayPal. Without the Strategy Pattern, you might use
if-else conditions to handle the different payment methods, leading to less
maintainable and flexible code.

What is the Strategy Pattern (in plain English)

Strategy Pattern = encapsulate behavior, not data, and make it interchangeable at runtime.

Bad code will have lot of if-else based processing here
