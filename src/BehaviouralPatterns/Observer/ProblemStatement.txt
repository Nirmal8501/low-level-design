We have a weather station and display devices which will display the real time temperature.
So a bad solution will be to have a tightly couples all display devices or a list inside the weather station object,
and as soon as temp is updated we need to notify all the display devices

So like,
WeatherStation{
    int temp,
    DisplayDevice device,

    constructor,

    setTemp(temp){
        this.temp = temp
        notifyDevice()
    }

    void notify(temp){
        device.showtemp(temp)
    }
}



This is a bad solution, also pretty tightly coupled. Also if you have to add more devices then you will have to edit this class each time.
Also, this is not even about that tbh, its more about who shd have control to what. Ideally weather shd not care about how many people are interested
in knowing the temp and shdn't own the logic, all it shd care is that "Whenever I have a change, i will announce it", this way it doesn't care
who is interested, and doesn;t know how many subscriber are there.

The station says:

“I don’t care who’s listening. I just announce a change.”

Observers say:

“I choose to listen.”

That shift is the whole pattern. Basically inversion of dependency

There can be lot of display devices as well.

So this hints to a probable pub sub solution, a single pulisher which is the weather station and multiple subscribers which are interested in temperature
which are our display devices.


So according to gang of 4,

DisplayDevice -> Some abstract class , this has addObserver, removeObserver and notifyObserver functionality,
and each device will implement the observer
