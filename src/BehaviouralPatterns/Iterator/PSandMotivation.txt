Motivation:
Suppose you have a collection, such as an array or list, and you need to
provide a mechanism for accessing its elements. Without the iterator pattern,
the client code needs to understand how the collection is structured, and
different collections would require different methods to traverse them.

Iterator is usually implemented as a nested class within the container class.
hasNext() and next(), so if in future u decide to keep set instead of array, u only need to edit these two methods and the main container class logic remains intact,
and the Client who uses ur Class and code doesn;t need to know your structure to iterate, because if the structure changes later then all clients will have to change
the logic to iterate, hence its better that ur class itself gives a way to iterate.

This also creates a separtion of concerns, iteration logic is separate, n u can make differnt type of iterators like forward, backward n so on
