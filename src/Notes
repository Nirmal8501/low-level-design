The real meaning behind the 3 pattern categories

Design patterns are not about what code looks like.
They are about what problem dimension you are controlling.

Category	    What it controls	    Question it answers
Creational	    Object birth	        Who creates what, when, and how?
Structural	    Object composition	    How are things connected without tight coupling?
Behavioral	    Object interaction	    Who talks to whom, and who decides?

This is not arbitrary — it maps to object lifecycle phases.

1️⃣ Creational Patterns — Control the birth
Semantic intent

Separate object creation from object usage

Creation is volatile:

config changes
environment changes
implementation changes
scaling changes
Usage should be stable.

Creational patterns exist to protect stable code from unstable construction logic.
