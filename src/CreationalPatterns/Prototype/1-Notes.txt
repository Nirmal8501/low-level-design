Prototype is the hardest creational pattern to “feel” because it doesn’t fix an obvious smell like if/else or enum + switch.

First: Why Prototype Feels Useless at First

Most people think:
“Why not just use new?”
That’s because most examples hide the real pain.

Prototype does NOT exist to:
reduce typing
avoid constructors for fun

It exists to solve copying + creation coupling problems.

The Core Intuition (THIS Is the Breakthrough)
Stop thinking:
“Prototype is an alternative to new”

Start thinking:
“Prototype is an alternative to re-running creation logic.”


Example 1: Graphic Editor (This Is the Canonical Case)
Problem Statement

You’re building a drawing app (Figma / Paint).

Users can:

draw a shape

duplicate it (Ctrl + D)

paste it many times

❌ Naive Approach (Feels Fine Initially)
class Rectangle {
    int x, y, width, height;
    Color color;
}


User clicks Duplicate.

How do you duplicate?

Rectangle copy = new Rectangle(
    original.x,
    original.y,
    original.width,
    original.height,
    original.color
);

Why this is actually bad
UI layer knows how to construct Rectangle
If Rectangle changes → UI breaks
Deep copy logic leaks everywhere
Works only if you know the concrete type

🔔 Intuition Trigger
“Why does the UI know how to copy a Rectangle?”

That’s the smell.

✅ Prototype Solution
interface Shape {
    Shape copy();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public Shape copy() {
        return new Rectangle(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height, this.color);
    }
}

Now UI just does:
Shape duplicate = selectedShape.copy();

Mental shift:
The object knows how to copy itself.


Example 2: Game Characters (This One Makes It Click)
Problem

In a game:

You have enemies

Many enemies share base attributes

But differ slightly

Example:

Goblin (base)

Goblin with sword

Goblin with armor

❌ Without Prototype (Constructor Hell)
new Enemy(type, hp, damage, armor, ai, animation, sounds);


Or:

Enemy goblin = new Enemy(...);
Enemy goblinWithSword = new Enemy(
    goblin.hp,
    goblin.damage + 10,
    goblin.armor,
    goblin.ai,
    goblin.animation
);


Now:

Spawning logic knows internals

Copy semantics are scattered

🔔 Intuition Trigger

“Spawning logic should not know how enemies are built.”

✅ Prototype Approach
Enemy goblinPrototype = new Enemy(...);

Enemy goblin1 = goblinPrototype.copy();
Enemy goblin2 = goblinPrototype.copy();
