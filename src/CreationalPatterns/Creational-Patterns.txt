Purpose: Creational patterns are focused on object creation mechanisms, aiming
to optimize the creation process while ensuring flexibility.

Goal: They abstract the instantiation process to make systems more flexible and
reusable.

Problem They Solve: Prevent tight coupling between code and object creation logic,
simplifying the management of new object creation, especially in complex systems.

Example:
● In a system where different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) are created,
instead of using new everywhere, a Factory Pattern can centralize object
creation.

● Inconsistent state: If multiple instances represent the same concept, they may
hold different data.
● Resource conflicts: If multiple instances of a resource-heavy class are
created, it can lead to performance degradation.

Where u need only single instance, like logger, configs, n so on,
like DBPassword, ApiKey n so on, if multiple instances exist then it can become problematic because if DBPassword changes and one object is updated n other is not
then problem, but at first place u don't need more than 1 obj.
