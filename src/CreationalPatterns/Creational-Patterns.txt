Purpose: Creational patterns are focused on object creation mechanisms, aiming
to optimize the creation process while ensuring flexibility.

Goal: They abstract the instantiation process to make systems more flexible and
reusable.

Problem They Solve: Prevent tight coupling between code and object creation logic,
simplifying the management of new object creation, especially in complex systems.
