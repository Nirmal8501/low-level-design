Builder Pattern:

When an object requires many parameters, especially optional ones, the constructor
can become hard to use or maintain. This issue can lead to:
1. Long constructor parameter lists.
2. Difficulty in understanding which values are optional or required.
3. Lack of flexibility when it comes to setting only some values.
For example, constructing an object with multiple optional parameters without the
Builder pattern can look tedious.
