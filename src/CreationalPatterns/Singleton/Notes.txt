Example:
● In a system where different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) are created,
instead of using new everywhere, a Factory Pattern can centralize object
creation.

● Inconsistent state: If multiple instances represent the same concept, they may
hold different data.
● Resource conflicts: If multiple instances of a resource-heavy class are
created, it can lead to performance degradation.

Where u need only single instance, like logger, configs, n so on,
like DBPassword, ApiKey n so on, if multiple instances exist then it can become problematic because if DBPassword changes and one object is updated n other is not
then problem, but at first place u don't need more than 1 obj.


Multi-threading issues: Without thread safety, multiple instances of the Singleton
class could be created in a multi-threaded environment.
Solutions:
○ Lazy Initialization with Synchronization: Synchronize the method that
creates the instance.
○ Double-Checked Locking: Optimize the performance by only locking
when necessary.
○ Bill Pugh Singleton Design: Uses an inner static helper class to ensure
thread safety and lazy loading.
